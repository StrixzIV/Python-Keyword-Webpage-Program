This is the first day of starting this project. I got a lot of good ideas flowing in my head, but I am just going to focus on getting something basic.

Something I was thinking about while doing it is that logically we probably don't care to grab the front page for now. If you are using this you aren't looking for headlines. Those are easy to find for a reason.
[This is a useful resource for understanding XPath which is what I am trying to figure out right now.](https://www.guru99.com/xpath-selenium.html).
I realized I might want to use BeautifulSoup in combination with Selenium for better Webscraping. I won't try it right now, but in the very near future I will be trying some stuff out.

I got a pretty good flow of what I am doing. I should have the Fox News website done by Tuesday. It is mostly just copy and paste. I think that I will try and make it more dynamic if I can. I honestly might not be able to, but it is what it is.

Back to working on this. I relaxed a good amount this weekend, but I am ready to present today. I have hit my first wall which is a little bit concerning, but I will work on fixing it. I need to do a good amount of research on what XPath is and how it works. It seems to be the best way to search for elements on a webpage, which I have been using. There is just so much to it.
